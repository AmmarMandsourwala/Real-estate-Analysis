# Real-estate-Analysis
The real estate sector generates vast volumes of data every day â€” from property listings and prices to buyer preferences and location trends. Interpreting this data is essential for realtors, investors, and analysts aiming to make well-informed, strategic decisions.

This project focuses on analyzing real estate data using Python-based data science techniques. With data taken from a real estate firm, the project explores the patterns, trends, and key factors influencing the property market.
